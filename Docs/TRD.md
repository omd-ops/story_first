### 2.1 Document Purpose

This Technical Requirements Document (TRD) details the technical vision, architecture, and implementation specifications for StoryFirst MVP. The document provides comprehensive technical guidance for the development, deployment, and maintenance of a gamified storytelling learning platform that delivers daily lessons via SMS, tracks user progress through XP and status systems, and fosters social accountability through Story Circles.

### 2.2 Relationship to PRD

This document translates the Business Requirements (BR-01, BR-02, BR-04 through BR-11, BR-13, BR-14) defined in the StoryFirst PRD into Technical Requirements (TR-01 through TR-14) with detailed implementation specifications. Each technical requirement section provides step-by-step implementation details, security considerations, data integrity requirements, and acceptance criteria needed to fulfill its corresponding business requirement from the PRD.

**Note:** BR-03 (Daily Review Session) and BR-12 (Post-Completion Experience) are deferred to Phase 2 and Phase 3 respectively, and do not have corresponding technical requirements in MVP.

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Proposed Architecture

**High-Level Architecture Pattern:**

- **Client Layer:** Next.js 15 web application (App Router) with responsive design optimized for mobile-first experience. Server-side rendering (SSR) for instant page loads via SMS magic links. Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for app-like experience without native app complexity.

- **Authentication Layer:** Supabase Auth with phone number authentication (magic links via SMS). No password required—users receive magic links to access lessons. JWT-based session management with secure token refresh. Admin authentication uses email/password with role-based access control (RBAC).
  - **API Layer:** Next.js Server Actions serving as primary API layer. Type-safe mutations with end-to-end type safety from database to UI. API Routes for webhooks (Twilio delivery status, Slack webhooks). Edge Runtime support for SMS trigger logic.

- **Services Layer:**
  - **AI Grading Service:** GPT-5 Mini (primary) + Gemini 2.5 Flash (fallback) for Q&A and Challenge evaluation with structured grading rubrics
  - **Speech-to-Text Service:** ElevenLabs STT for high-quality audio transcription (user responses only - Q&A and Challenge audio recordings)
  - **Text-to-Speech Service:** ElevenLabs TTS for generating personalized audio intros and wrap-ups (Pre/Post-Lesson personalization)
  - **SMS Service:** Twilio Programmable SMS for daily lesson triggers and notifications
  - **Background Jobs Service:** Vercel Cron + QStash for scheduled daily triggers, SMS job queue with rate limiting, automatic retries, and XP/streak calculations
  - **Webhook Service:** Zapier webhooks for milestone notifications (status changes, streak milestones, completion) with Slack integration
  - **LLM Observability Service:** Prompt versioning and editing managed in Admin Panel (no external service required)

- **Data Layer:**
  - **Primary Database:** PostgreSQL (Supabase) for users, lessons, responses, XP, streaks, circles, leaderboards
  - **Authentication:** Supabase Auth tables for user sessions and phone verification
  - **File Storage:** Supabase Storage for audio recordings and audio file uploads (Q&A, Challenge responses), user-generated content, and SRT caption files (generated from ElevenLabs TTS word timestamps)
  - **Video Infrastructure:** Mux for video ingestion, encoding, storage, and adaptive streaming of lesson videos

Shadcn/UI: **Pre-built accessible components** (dialogs, forms, tooltips) that work perfectly with Tailwind.                                                                                                                                                                              | Consistent styling reduces UI bugs; accessible components ensure WCAG compliance; optimal bundle size improves load times.                                                                                                            | Free (open source)                                            |
| **Link Shortening**                  | **Short.io**                                     | **Custom branded domain support** for SMS magic links with per-link expiration (24-hour TTL), link revocation, and advanced click analytics. API-first approach enables programmatic link creation before SMS send. Multi-channel support (SMS, email, web). SMS provider agnostic - not locked to Twilio.                                                                                              | Branded links enhance user trust and engagement. Per-link expiration ensures security for magic links. Link revocation provides security control. Advanced analytics track user engagement.                                                                                                            | **$18/mo** (Pro plan)                                        |

**Summary: User Onboarding and Authentication Flow**

| Step                    | What Happens                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. User signs up        | User lands on in-app registration page (redirect from marketing page). Submits waitlist form with name, email, phone, "how you heard about it" (required), goals/reminder time (optional). |
| 2. Signup stored        | API validates phone number, checks for duplicates, stores in `users` table with status='pending'. |
| 3. Admin notified       | Admin receives dashboard notification AND Slack message (webhook) for new signup. Admin Panel shows pending approvals count badge on signup queue. |
| 4. Admin reviews        | Admin reviews waitlist, moves users up/down priority, adds notes, approves when ready (or rejects) with optional message. |
| 5. Admin approves       | If approved: Admin clicks "Approve" → API creates Supabase Auth user account                                              |
| 6. User profile created | API creates user profile in `users` table, `user_details` table with initial values (status_level: 0, xp: 0, streak: 0), and `user_lessons` table for Day 0 (status='unlocked')            |
| 7. Magic link generated | Supabase Auth generates magic link with redirect to onboarding                                               |
| 8. Welcome SMS sent     | Twilio sends SMS to user with magic link                                                                     |
| 9. Tips email sent      | "Tips and tricks" email sent simultaneously upon approval                                                    |
| 10. User clicks link    | User clicks magic link from SMS                                                                              |
| 11. Authentication      | Supabase Auth validates token, creates session                                                               |
| 12. Profile setup       | User redirected to onboarding profile page to complete profile                                               |
| 13. Day 0 access        | After profile completion, user gains access to Day 0 orientation lesson                                      |
| 14. Day 1 access        | Day 1 immediately unlocks after Day 0 completion (no gap)                                                    |

**Summary: Daily Lesson Flow**

| Step                         | What Happens                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Scheduled trigger         | Vercel Cron runs every 15 minutes, queries Supabase for users needing SMS (database-driven scheduling)                              |
| 2. User query                | System queries: `SELECT users WHERE preferred_time <= NOW() AND sms_sent_today = false`                                             |
| 3. Batch to queue            | System pushes entire batch (50-100 users) to QStash queue in one API call                                                           |
| 4. QStash distribution       | QStash spawns 30 parallel workers (matches Twilio rate limit), delivers jobs as HTTP requests                                       |
| 5. SMS worker                | Each API route worker: Generates magic link → Creates Short.io shortened link (24h expiration) → Sends Twilio SMS → Marks user as sent                                                 |
| 6. Automatic retries         | If Twilio SMS fails, QStash automatically retries with exponential backoff                                                          |
| 5. User clicks link          | User clicks magic link from SMS                                                                                                     |
| 6. SSR page load             | Next.js SSR verifies session and queries `user_lessons` table to check lesson access (sequential unlock enforced via status check)                                                           |
| 7. Lesson content fetched    | System fetches lesson blocks from database (includes Mux asset ID, playback ID, and status for Direct Instruction blocks)                                                                                          |
| 8.

## 4. Technical Requirements Mapping

### 4.1 BR-01 → TR-01: User Onboarding and Authentication

**Business Requirement Summary:**

Users sign up via in-app waitlist on the app registration page (marketing page is static and redirects to app); admin reviews waitlist (moves users up/down priority, adds notes) and approves when ready; approved users receive magic link via SMS and complete full onboarding (phone verification, goals, schedule, Coach Devon); users optionally invite friends (Status 2 benefits).

**Priority:** Critical  
**PRD Reference:** Section BR-01

**What it does:** Provides complete user onboarding flow from waitlist registration through profile completion. Marketing page is static (no forms); Register for Waitlist button redirects to the app registration page. In-app waitlist form collects signup information; admin reviews waitlist (priority order, notes) and approves when ready; approved users receive magic link via SMS; users complete full onboarding and optionally invite friends. Day 0 orientation lesson unlocks after profile completion.

**Steps:**

1. User lands on app registration page (via redirect from marketing page "Register for Waitlist" button; marketing page is static, no forms) → Submits waitlist form (name, email, phone, "how you heard about it" required, goals and reminder time optional) → Form POSTs to signup API endpoint
2. API validates phone number format and checks for duplicates → Stores signup in `users` table with status='pending' (includes name, phone, email, referral_source, signup_goal)
3. Admin receives dashboard notification AND Slack message (webhook) for new signup → Admin Panel shows pending approvals count badge on signup queue
4. Admin reviews waitlist → Views users where status='pending' → Can move users up/down priority, add notes → Approves when ready (or rejects) with optional message
5. Approval process → Updates user record (status='approved') → Creates Supabase Auth user account (phone authentication) → Generates magic link → Sends welcome SMS via Twilio
6. User clicks magic link from SMS → Supabase Auth validates token → Redirects to onboarding profile page if profile incomplete
7. User completes profile setup (display name, goal selection, timezone, SMS schedule):
   - Goal selection: User selects goals in ranked order (maximum 3 goals, primary goal first)
   - Primary goal (first ranked) used for circle assignment
   - Secondary/tertiary goals stored for analytics (not actively used in MVP)
   → Server Action updates user record
8. After profile completion → Creates `user_lessons` record for Day 0 (status='unlocked') → Redirects to Day 0 orientation lesson → Day 1 immediately unlocks after Day 0 completion (creates Day 1 record with status='unlocked')
9. Optional "Join with Friends" (during onboarding): User asked "Do you have people you want to go on this journey with?" → If Yes (2-3 friends): User provides friend contacts (phone numbers) → Friend contacts stored in `friend_contacts` table for admin review → Admin reviews friend relationships in dashboard → Admin manually creates private circle and assigns both users → Status 2 auto-granted to both users when circle is created → Private circle available from Day 1 → If Yes (team/company): Shows "Contact Admin" instead of "Invite your people" → User indicates interest → Email sent to Admin → Admin handles manually (optionally: shareable link to info page for team signups) → If No: User starts solo (assigned to goal-based circle by admin later)

**Security:**

- Phone numbers validated using libphonenumber library
- Duplicate phone check before signup submission
- Admin authentication required for approval queue access (RBAC)
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies on all user tables
- Rate limiting on signup endpoint (10 requests per hour per IP)
- Magic links expire after 24 hours

**Data Integrity:**

- Signup submissions stored in `users` table with status='pending'
- User accounts created atomically with profile data
- Friend contacts stored in `friend_contacts` table for admin review
- Profile completion status tracked in `users` table

**Data Reliability:**

- Signup submissions persist across system restarts
- User account creation is atomic (all-or-nothing)
- Magic links validated server-side before authentication
- Failed SMS sends retried automatically via QStash

**Critical Requirements:**

- Signup form MUST validate phone number format before submission
- Admin approval MUST create user account atomically
- Magic links MUST expire after 24 hours
- Profile completion MUST unlock Day 0 orientation lesson
- "Join with Friends" MUST grant Status 2 to both users
- **Timezone verification for notifications:** When user selects a time (lesson reminder or snooze), the system MUST resolve the user's timezone to schedule delivery correctly. Users are globally located; all notifications MUST be delivered in the user's local time. System uses stored timezone preference; device/browser timezone as fallback if needed.

**Database Schema:**

See Section 6.3 Data Dictionary for detailed table definitions (`users`, `friend_contacts`).

### 4.2 BR-02 → TR-02: Daily Lesson Delivery System

**Business Requirement Summary:**

Users receive daily SMS trigger at their scheduled time (user-configurable), SMS contains magic link to today's lesson, lesson follows flow: Pre-Lesson intro (Gen AI personalized intro via ElevenLabs TTS with template-based personalization) → Direct Instruction (karaoke captions) → Q&A → Challenge → Post-Lesson wrap-up (Gen AI personalized wrap-up via ElevenLabs TTS with template-based personalization), sequential unlock (Day 2 unlocks after Day 1 completion), rolling content delivery model (7-10 days at MVP launch).

**Priority:** Critical  
**PRD Reference:** Section BR-02

**What it does:** Delivers daily lesson content to users via SMS magic links. Vercel Cron queries users needing SMS every 15 minutes, QStash queue processes SMS delivery with rate limiting, users access lessons via magic links, complete lesson flow (Pre-Lesson → Direct Instruction → Q&A → Challenge → Post-Lesson), audio responses transcribed and graded, sequential unlock prevents skipping ahead.

**Steps:**

1. Vercel Cron runs every 15 minutes → Queries Supabase for users needing SMS (database-driven scheduling)
2. System queries: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE preferred_time <= NOW() AND sms_sent_today = false` → Returns batch of 50-100 users
3. System pushes entire batch to QStash queue in one API call
4. QStash spawns 30 parallel workers (matches Twilio rate limit) → Delivers jobs as HTTP requests
5. Each worker: Generates magic link via Supabase Auth → Selects message variant (based on streak) → Sends SMS via Twilio → Marks user as sent
6. User clicks magic link from SMS → Next.js SSR verifies session → Queries `user_lessons` table to check lesson access (status must be 'unlocked' or 'in_progress', or sequential_unlock_override=true)
7. Lesson flow: Pre-Lesson intro (Gen AI personalized intro via ElevenLabs TTS with template-based personalization and karaoke captions) → Direct Instruction video (karaoke captions) → Personalization Transition (Gen AI transition via ElevenLabs TTS with karaoke captions) → Q&A (text/audio/MCQ/audio upload responses) → Challenge (text/audio/MCQ/audio upload responses) → Post-Lesson wrap-up (Gen AI personalized wrap-up via ElevenLabs TTS with template-based personalization and karaoke captions)
   - **Pre-Lesson/Post-Lesson caption flow:** ElevenLabs TTS generates audio with word-level timestamps → Server generates SRT file → SRT saved to Supabase Storage → Frontend converts SRT to WebVTT → Attaches `<track>` to audio player → TextTrack API syncs phrases → Word-level segments enable karaoke highlighting via requestAnimationFrame
8. User responses: Text responses stored directly, Audio/Audio Upload responses uploaded to Supabase Storage → Audio transcribed via ElevenLabs STT (audio responses only) → All responses graded via GPT-5 Mini → Store in `user_responses` table
9. Lesson completion: Server Action calculates XP → Updates streak → Updates `user_lessons` table (status='completed', completed_at=now()) → Unlocks next lesson (status='unlocked') → Checks status progression → Fires celebration triggers → Redirects to Feed

**Security:**

- Magic links expire after 24 hours
- Sequential unlock prevents users from skipping ahead
- Admin override requires admin authentication
- Privacy notice displayed and acknowledged before first audio recording (one-time per user)
- Audio recordings and audio file uploads stored with user-specific paths in Supabase Storage
- Row-Level Security (RLS) on all user data tables
- Rate limiting on recording/upload (max 3 uploads per minute per user)
- Audio file size limit (10MB max)
- Text response limit (2000 characters per question, configurable presets)
- Audio recording limit (120 seconds per question)
- Each question has independent limits (limits apply per question, not per lesson)
- Transcription and grading requests rate limited

**Data Integrity:**

- SMS sends logged in `sms_logs` table (delivery status tracked by Twilio, not stored)
- User responses stored with audio URL, transcription, and grading
- SRT caption files stored in Supabase Storage (generated from ElevenLabs TTS word timestamps)
- SRT files linked to audio via playback ID in filename (enables frontend to retrieve correct captions)
- Lesson completion updates XP, streak, and status atomically (single transaction)
- Sequential unlock enforced at database level (`user_lessons` table status check)
- All XP transactions logged in `user_activity` table (event_type='xp_award') for audit trail

**Data Reliability:**

- SMS delivery retries automatically via QStash (exponential backoff)
- Failed transcriptions retry up to 3 times
- Lesson state persists across page refreshes
- Audio uploads validated before storage
- Magic links validated server-side before authentication

**Critical Requirements:**

- SMS MUST be delivered at user's scheduled/preferred time (user-configurable during onboarding)
- Magic links MUST expire after 24 hours
- Sequential unlock MUST prevent users from skipping ahead
- Audio transcription MUST use ElevenLabs STT (user audio only, not video)
- Lesson completion MUST update XP, streak, and status atomically
- QStash MUST handle rate limiting (30 concurrent workers matches Twilio limit)

**Database Schema:**

See Section 6.3 Data Dictionary for detailed table definitions (`lessons`, `lesson_blocks`, `user_responses`, `sms_logs`).

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users receive SMS at their scheduled time (user-configurable)
- [ ] SMS contains personalized message variant based on streak
- [ ] Magic link grants access to current day's lesson only
- [ ] Pre-Lesson intro is personalized via ElevenLabs TTS using templates (user name, current lesson day from user_lessons, streak from database)
- [ ] Pre-Lesson intro displays karaoke-style captions (SRT generated from ElevenLabs word timestamps, converted to WebVTT, synced via TextTrack API, word-by-word highlighting via requestAnimationFrame)
- [ ] Direct Instruction video plays with karaoke-style captions
- [ ] Users can submit responses for Q&A and Challenge using: text (2000 characters max), audio (120 seconds max), MCQ, or audio upload
- [ ] Privacy notice shown before FIRST audio recording only (user acknowledges once)
- [ ] Each question has independent response limits (text 2000 chars, audio 120 seconds)
- [ ] Audio responses are transcribed via ElevenLabs STT 
- [ ] Responses are graded via GPT-5 Mini with structured feedback
- [ ] Post-Lesson wrap-up is personalized via ElevenLabs TTS using templates (user name, XP, streak, status from database)
- [ ] Post-Lesson wrap-up displays karaoke-style captions (SRT generated from ElevenLabs word timestamps, converted to WebVTT, synced via TextTrack API, word-by-word highlighting via requestAnimationFrame)
- [ ] Users cannot skip ahead to future days (sequential unlock)
- [ ] Admin can override sequential unlock if needed
- [ ] Rolling content delivery: MVP launches with 7-10 days, more added later
- [ ] Lesson completion updates XP, streak, and status progression

### 4.3 BR-11 → TR-03: Content Management System

**Business Requirement Summary:**

Admin panel with block-based CMS for lesson creation, content team (Holly, Jessie) can upload lessons incrementally, block types: Pre-Lesson intro template, Direct Instruction video upload (client-provided video, captions generated automatically via ElevenLabs STT → Mux tracks), Q&A question with rubric, Challenge question with rubric, Post-Lesson wrap-up template, ability to edit/reorder blocks, preview lesson before publishing.

**Priority:** Critical  
**PRD Reference:** Section BR-11 (Content Management System subsection)

**What it does:** Provides block-based content management system for lesson creation. Admin can create lessons with multiple block types (Pre-Lesson, Direct Instruction, Q&A, Challenge, Post-Lesson), upload client-provided videos (captions generated automatically via ElevenLabs STT → Mux tracks), define rubrics and XP rewards, configure personalization templates for Pre/Post-Lesson blocks (personalized via ElevenLabs TTS), reorder blocks via drag-and-drop, preview lessons before publishing, and publish lessons to make them available to users.

**Steps:**

1. Admin navigates to lesson builder (`/admin/lessons/builder/[day]`) → Enters lesson metadata (title, objective)
2. Admin adds blocks via menu → Selects block type → Block-specific editor opens
3. Pre-Lesson/Post-Lesson blocks: Admin configures personalization template with placeholders ({name}, {day}, {streak}, {xp}, {status}) → System fills template with user data from database → ElevenLabs TTS generates personalized audio with word-level timestamps → Server generates SRT file with timestamps → SRT saved to Supabase Storage → Preview shows mock personalized content
   - **Background configuration:** Admin can configure background (transparent, color, image, or looping video) → For Personalization blocks: Background SHOULD match the main Direct Instruction video for visual consistency → Looping video stored in Supabase Storage or Mux (TBD)
   - **Dynamic visual layer (optional):** Admin can optionally enable blob or waveform layer → When enabled, visual MUST be synced with ElevenLabs voice playback → Implementation options: (a) video layer with waveform baked in, or (b) CSS-animated blob + audio-driven waveform (POC recommended) → Admin can select blob/waveform style per block
   - **Karaoke-style captions:** Active word highlighted (e.g., white); upcoming words darker or ~50% opacity → Applies to Personalization block (auto-generated from ElevenLabs TTS) and Direct Instruction (from Mux tracks) → Caption styling consistent across both block types
4. Direct Instruction block: Admin uploads client-provided video (max 500MB) → Uploads to Mux via API → Mux handles encoding and storage → System receives asset ID and playback ID → Stores both IDs plus status in `lesson_blocks.content` JSONB → Webhook updates status when encoding completes → System extracts audio from Mux video → ElevenLabs STT transcribes audio with timestamps → Server generates SRT file → SRT added as Mux track via Mux API → Mux Player displays video with karaoke-style captions
5. Q&A/Challenge blocks: Admin enters question/prompt → Selects response type (text/audio/MCQ/audio upload) → Configures response settings:
   - Text: Sets character limit (presets: short/medium/long or custom, max 2000 characters)
   - Audio: Sets time limit (default 120 seconds per question)
   - MCQ: Sets number of options, single/multiple correct answers, option text
   - Audio Upload: Sets file size limits (max 10MB)
   → Sets time limit → Selects grading prompt/rubric from `ai_prompts` table (or creates new one) → Sets XP reward
6. Admin reorders blocks via drag-and-drop → Updates `order_index` in database
7. Admin clicks "Preview" → Opens preview route with mock user data → Displays full lesson flow
8. Admin clicks "Save Draft" → Lesson saved with status='draft' → Not visible to users
9. Admin clicks "Publish" → System validates required blocks exist → Updates status='published' → Lesson available to users

**Security:**

- Only admin users can access lesson builder
- Video uploads limited to 500MB max file size
- Only specific video formats allowed (mp4, mov, webm)
- Videos uploaded to Mux (not Supabase Storage)
- Mux asset ID and playback ID stored in block content JSONB (both required)
- Asset status tracked in JSONB (ready, processing, errored)
- Video URLs automatically constructed by Mux Player SDK from playback ID
- Row-Level Security (RLS) on lessons and lesson_blocks tables
- Draft lessons not visible to regular users
- Published lessons can be edited (creates new version)

**Data Integrity:**

- Lesson blocks stored with `order_index` for sequence
- Block content stored in JSONB format (flexible structure)
- Direct Instruction blocks store Mux video data in JSONB:
  - `mux_asset_id` (required): Used for API operations (get details, add tracks, delete)
  - `mux_playback_id` (required): Used by Mux Player SDK for video playback
  - `mux_status` (required): Asset processing status (ready, processing, errored)
  - `mux_duration` (optional): Video duration in seconds
  - `mux_aspect_ratio` (optional): Video aspect ratio (e.g., "16:9")
  - `mux_created_at` (optional): Asset creation timestamp
- Video URLs: Mux Player SDK automatically constructs video URLs from playback ID (no manual URL storage needed)
- Caption data stored in block content JSONB (SRT/VTT URLs or inline captions)
- **Personalization blocks (Pre-Lesson/Post-Lesson):** SRT files generated from ElevenLabs TTS word timestamps → Saved to Supabase Storage → Frontend converts to WebVTT for playback
- **Personalization block background:** Background configuration supported (transparent, color, image, looping video) → For Personalization blocks: Background SHOULD match Direct Instruction video for visual consistency → Looping video stored in Supabase Storage or Mux (TBD)
- **Personalization block visual layer:** Optional blob or waveform layer → MUST be synced with ElevenLabs voice playback → Implementation: video layer with waveform baked in, or CSS-animated blob + audio-driven waveform → Admin can select style per block
- Lesson status ('draft' vs 'published') controls visibility
- Cascade delete: Deleting lesson deletes all blocks

**Data Reliability:**

- Draft lessons persist across system restarts
- Video uploads validated before Mux upload
- Mux handles video encoding and storage automatically
- Block reordering updates database atomically
- Preview uses mock data (doesn't affect real lessons)

**Critical Requirements:**

- Content team (Holly, Jessie) MUST be able to use CMS without developer help
- Video uploads MUST support mp4, mov, webm formats
- Video captions generated via ElevenLabs STT: Video uploaded to Mux → Audio extracted → ElevenLabs STT transcribes → SRT generated → Added as Mux track → Mux Player displays captions
- **Personalization block captions:** ElevenLabs TTS MUST provide word-level timestamps → Server MUST generate SRT files → Frontend MUST convert SRT to WebVTT → TextTrack API MUST sync phrases automatically
- **Personalization block background:** MUST support background configuration (transparent, color, image, looping video) → For Personalization blocks: Background SHOULD match Direct Instruction video for visual consistency
- **Personalization block visual layer:** MAY include dynamic visual layer (blob or waveform) → When present, MUST be synced with ElevenLabs voice playback → Implementation options: video layer with waveform baked in, or CSS-animated blob + audio-driven waveform (POC recommended) → Optional configuration: select blob/waveform style per block
- **Karaoke caption styling:** Active word highlighted (e.g., white); upcoming words darker or ~50% opacity → Applies to Personalization block (auto-generated from ElevenLabs TTS) and Direct Instruction (from Mux tracks)
- Required blocks MUST exist before publishing
- Draft lessons MUST NOT be visible to regular users

### 4.4 BR-04 → TR-04: XP and Status System

**Business Requirement Summary:**

Users progress through status levels based on XP earned. User actions are assigned XP values, and reaching XP thresholds unlocks status levels. Status is permanent once earned. Admin can override status for any user.

**Priority:** Critical  
**PRD Reference:** Section BR-04

**What it does:** Tracks user XP earned from lesson completions and awards status levels based on XP thresholds. XP awarded for Q&A completion (base XP) and Challenge completion (bonus XP). Status progression unlocks features (Status 1: AI Feedback, Status 2: Story Circles, Status 3: Pause Tokens). Status is permanent once earned. Admin can override status for any user.

**Steps:**

1. User completes Q&A → Server Action awards base XP (default: 1 XP) → Inserts into `user_activity` table (event_type='xp_award') → Updates `user_details.total_xp` atomically
2. User completes Challenge → Server Action awards bonus XP (default: 2 XP) → Inserts into `user_activity` table (event_type='xp_award') → Updates `user_details.total_xp` atomically
3. After each XP award → System checks status progression → Queries `admin_config` table for current status thresholds → Compares `user_details.total_xp` against thresholds
4. If threshold reached → Updates `user_details.status_level` → Logs in `user_activity` table (event_type='status_change') → Fires celebration trigger → Grants pause tokens if Status 3
5. Admin configures XP values → Navigates to `/admin/config/xp` → Sets Q&A base XP, Challenge bonus XP, status thresholds → Updates `admin_config` table (config_key='xp_values' or 'status_thresholds', config_value)
6. Admin overrides status → Navigates to `/admin/users/[userId]/status` → Selects new status level → System updates status → Logs in `admin_actions` table (action_type='status_override', user_id, old_value, new_value)
7. "Join with Friends" → Admin creates private circle with both users → System grants Status 2 to both users → Logs in `user_activity` table (event_type='status_change', metadata.reason='join_with_friends')

**Security:**

- XP values validated to be positive integers
- Status progression only increases (never decreases)
- Admin override requires admin authentication
- All XP and status changes logged for audit trail

### 4.5 BR-05 → TR-05: Streak Tracking System

**Business Requirement Summary:**

Track consecutive days of lesson completion. Streak increments when Q&A is completed. 24-hour window to complete lesson without breaking streak. Pause token system: All users start with 3 tokens. If user misses a day and has pause tokens, token is automatically consumed and streak is preserved. If user misses a day and has no pause tokens, streak resets to 0.

**Priority:** Critical  
**PRD Reference:** Section BR-05

**What it does:** Tracks consecutive days of lesson completion (streaks). Streak increments when Q&A is completed. 24-hour window (midnight to midnight in user's timezone) allows completion without breaking streak. Pause token system preserves streaks when users miss days. All users start with 3 tokens, earn more at status levels. Streak status is checked via queries when needed (no background job required).

**Steps:**

1. User completes Q&A → Server Action `updateStreak()` checks if completed today (in user's timezone) → If yes and not already updated today: Increments `user_details.current_streak` → Updates `user_details.longest_streak` if current > longest → Logs in `user_activity` table (event_type='streak_change')
2. When checking streak status (e.g., on login, lesson access, or profile view): System queries user's last completion date in their timezone → If > 24 hours ago: Checks `user_details.pause_tokens_remaining`
3. If tokens > 0: Decrements `user_details.pause_tokens_remaining` → Preserves `user_details.current_streak` → Logs in `user_activity` table (event_type='streak_change', metadata.reason='pause_token_used') and (event_type='pause_token_change', amount=-1)
4. If tokens = 0: Resets `user_details.current_streak = 0` → Logs in `user_activity` table (event_type='streak_change', metadata.reason='streak_broken') → Fires re-engagement trigger
5. Status progression: When user reaches Status 1 (+1 token), Status 2 (+2 tokens), Status 3 (+3 tokens) → System increments `user_details.pause_tokens_remaining` → Logs in `user_activity` table (event_type='pause_token_change')
6. Token display: User profile shows "Pause Tokens: X remaining" → Token history displayed in expandable section (queries `user_activity` table filtered by event_type='pause_token_change')

**Security:**

- Streak calculations use user's timezone setting
- Timezone changes apply to future triggers only (not retroactive)
- Pause token consumption is automatic (no user manipulation)
- All streak and token changes logged for audit trail
- Row-Level Security (RLS) on all user data tables

**Data Integrity:**

- Streak changes logged in `user_activity` table (event_type='streak_change', old_value.streak, new_value.streak, metadata.reason optional)
- Pause token changes logged in `user_activity` table (event_type='pause_token_change', amount, metadata.remaining_after, metadata.action_type, metadata.reason optional)
- Streak updates are atomic (single transaction)
- Token consumption tracked with remaining count after each action

**Data Reliability:**

- Streak calculations persist across system restarts
- Streak status checked via queries when needed
- Failed streak updates don't corrupt user data
- Timezone changes apply to future calculations only

**Critical Requirements:**

- Streak MUST increment when Q&A is completed
- 24-hour window MUST be calculated in user's timezone
- Pause tokens MUST be consumed automatically when day missed
- Streak MUST reset to 0 if no tokens available
- All users MUST start with 3 pause tokens
- Token earnings MUST be granted at status levels

**Database Schema:**

See Section 6.3 Data Dictionary for detailed table definitions (`user_activity`).

### 4.6 BR-06 → TR-06: Leaderboard System

**Business Requirement Summary:**

Display leaderboards showing top performers by streak length (for MVP simplicity). Two leaderboard types: Global (all users) and Circle (if user is in a circle). Always show top 5 users. If user is in top 5, highlight their position. If user is not in top 5, show top 5 + user's position below.

**Priority:** High  
**PRD Reference:** Section BR-06

**What it does:** Displays leaderboards showing top 5 users by streak (for MVP simplicity). Two types: Global (all users) and Circle (circle members). Rankings calculated on-demand via API queries when user views Feed screen. User's position highlighted if in top 5, shown below if not.

**Steps:**

1. User views Feed screen → API endpoint receives request for leaderboard data
2. Global leaderboard query: API queries top 5 users using `SELECT u.id, ud.current_streak FROM users u JOIN user_details ud ON u.id = ud.user_id ORDER BY ud.current_streak DESC LIMIT 5`
3. If user in top 5: Highlights user's position with different background color
4. If user not in top 5: API queries user's rank using `SELECT RANK() OVER (ORDER BY ud.current_streak DESC) as rank FROM users u JOIN user_details ud ON u.id = ud.user_id WHERE u.id = ?` → Displays "You are #X" below top 5
5. Circle leaderboard (if user in circle): API queries top 5 circle members using `SELECT u.id, ud.current_streak FROM users u JOIN user_details ud ON u.id = ud.user_id JOIN circle_members cm ON u.id = cm.user_id WHERE cm.circle_id = ? ORDER BY ud.current_streak DESC LIMIT 5`
6. UI displays leaderboard data and animates using Framer Motion

**Security:**

- Leaderboard data is read-only for regular users
- Only active users included in leaderboards
- Leaderboard queries use read-only access to `users` and `circle_members` tables

**Data Integrity:**

- Leaderboard rankings calculated on-demand via SQL queries
- User position calculated using SQL window functions (`RANK() OVER`)
- Circle leaderboards filtered by `circle_id` via JOIN with `circle_members` table
- Rankings always reflect current streak values from `users` table

**Data Reliability:**

- Leaderboard queries always use current data from `users` table
- Rankings automatically reflect latest streak values
- Failed queries don't affect user experience (graceful error handling)
- Leaderboards refresh when user views Feed screen (on page load)

**Critical Requirements:**

- Leaderboards MUST show top 5 users by streak (for MVP simplicity)
- Global leaderboard MUST include all active users
- Circle leaderboard MUST include only circle members
- User's position MUST be highlighted if in top 5
- Rankings MUST be calculated on-demand when user views Feed screen

**Database Schema:**

### 4.7 BR-07B → TR-07: AI Feedback Approval System

**Business Requirement Summary:**

Status 1+ users receive AI-generated grading on their Q&A and Challenge responses. AI generates draft feedback asynchronously after user submission. Admin team reviews and approves all AI feedback via Admin Panel before delivery to users. Approved feedback is delivered weekly (batched), not immediately after submission.

**Priority:** Critical  
**PRD Reference:** Section BR-07B

**What it does:** Generates AI feedback for Status 1+ users on Q&A and Challenge responses. Audio responses transcribed via ElevenLabs STT, all responses (text/audio/MCQ/audio upload) graded via GPT-5 Mini using prompts and rubrics from `ai_prompts` table, stored in `grading` table with status='pending'. Admin reviews and approves/rejects feedback via Admin Panel. Approved feedback delivered weekly in batches to users via in-app inbox. Rejected feedback regenerated automatically (max 3 attempts).

**Steps:**

1. User submits Q&A/Challenge response (text/audio/MCQ/audio upload) → System checks `user_details.status_level >= 1` → If Status 0: Shows completion message, stores response for future feedback
2. If Status 1+: Audio responses transcribed via ElevenLabs STT (if applicable) → Transcription stored → QStash job triggered for AI feedback generation
3. QStash delivers job to API route → System loads active prompt from `ai_prompts` table (based on response type: Q&A or Challenge) → GPT-5 Mini generates feedback using prompt and rubric (Q&A: correctness score, Challenge: 4 dimension scores + written feedback) → Stored in `grading` table with status='pending'
4. Admin navigates to review queue (`/admin/feedback/review`) → Views pending feedbacks → Clicks feedback to review → Sees user info, question, transcription, AI feedback
5. Admin approves/edits/rejects feedback → If approved: Updates `final_feedback` and `status='approved'` → If edited: Tracks changes in `admin_edits` JSONB → If rejected: Admin clicks "Reject & Regenerate" button → System immediately triggers AI to generate new feedback (no manual write required) → Marks `status='rejected'`, sets `notes` with rejection reason → Increments `regeneration_attempts` counter
6. Weekly batch delivery: Vercel Cron runs Monday 9am UTC → Queries approved feedbacks not yet delivered → Groups by user_id → Delivers to users via in-app inbox → Updates `delivered_at` timestamp
7. Rejected feedback regeneration: When admin clicks "Reject & Regenerate" → QStash job immediately triggered → Re-runs AI generation (max 3 attempts) → Stores new feedback with status='pending' → Admin reviews again

**Security:**

- Only Status 1+ users receive AI feedback
- Status 0 responses stored for future feedback
- Admin authentication required for review queue
- All feedback changes logged for audit trail
- Row-Level Security (RLS) on feedback tables

**Data Integrity:**

- All feedback stored in `grading` table with status tracking
- **Original AI feedback:** Stored in `ai_feedback` JSONB (never overwritten, preserved for audit trail)

Social cohort groups where users learn alongside peers with similar goals. Circles are admin-controlled in MVP (no automatic matching algorithm). Private circles available from Day 1 for users who invite friends. Goal-based circles assigned manually by admin.

**Priority:** High  
**PRD Reference:** Section BR-08

**What it does:** Provides social cohort groups (Story Circles) for users to learn alongside peers. Three circle types: Private (created when users join with friends), Goal-Based (admin-created, 7 default circles), Custom (admin-created). Admin manually assigns users to circles. Circle leaderboards show top 5 members. WhatsApp links shared for communication (MVP).

**Steps:**

1. Private circle creation: User provides friend contacts during onboarding → Friend contacts stored in `friend_contacts` table → Admin reviews friend relationships in dashboard → Admin manually creates private circle → Admin assigns both users to circle → System grants Status 2 to both users automatically when circle is created → Private circle available from Day 1
2. Goal-based circles: Seven default circles created on system initialization → Admin assigns users manually via Admin Panel → Assignment based on goal match, status, group requests
3. Custom circles: Admin creates via Admin Panel → Sets circle name and type → Assigns users manually
4. Circle assignment: Admin navigates to `/admin/circles/assign` → Selects users → Assigns to circles → System stores in `circle_members` table → Users can belong to multiple circles
5. Assignment flags: Admin dashboard highlights users who reached thresholds but not assigned → Helps admin prioritize assignments
6. Circle leaderboards: System recalculates circle leaderboards → Uses same logic as global leaderboards → Filters by `circle_id` → Shows top 5 members
7. Communication: Admin shares WhatsApp group links via Admin Panel → Admin can send bulk SMS/email to circle members

**Security:**

- Circle assignment requires admin authentication
- Users cannot self-assign to goal-based circles
- Private circles only accessible to members
- Row-Level Security (RLS) on circles and circle_members tables

**Priority:** Critical  
**PRD Reference:** Section BR-09

**What it does:** Provides main app navigation with two tabs (Learn and Feed). Learn tab displays 70-day roadmap with lesson states (completed, current, locked, coming soon). Feed tab displays progress widget, leaderboard preview, and content tiles (quotes, tips, stats, announcements). Feed is default homepage after lesson completion. Content displayed chronologically (newest first) with like functionality.

**Steps:**

1. User navigates app → Two tabs displayed: Learn and Feed → Fixed bottom navigation
2. Learn tab: Displays 70-day roadmap/journey view (like Legends) → Lessons grouped by pillar/theme (NOT by "week") → 10 groups of 7 lessons each → Labels: "Circle 1, 2, 3..." or "Story Journey 1, 2..." (avoid "Week") → Queries `user_lessons` table for lesson states (completed: checkmark, current: highlighted where status='unlocked' or status='in_progress' with highest day_number, locked: grayed out, coming soon: "Coming Soon") → User clicks current day → Accesses lesson → Clicking locked day shows "Unlocks on Day X" message
3. Feed tab: Displays three sections → Section 1: Progress widget (streak, XP, status, pause tokens) → Section 2: Leaderboard preview (global + circle) → Section 3: Content tiles (chronological)
4. Content tiles: Admin uploads via Admin Panel → Sets content type, publish date → Admin can pin posts (pin toggle per post) → Pinned posts always appear at top of feed (override chronological order for all users) → Content displayed chronologically (newest first, pinned posts first) → Users can like content → Users see if they liked it → Users can share Feed content to social or by email (share globally, same content for all users; mimics Legends share behavior)
5. Feed refresh: Pull-to-refresh gesture → Refetches all sections → Auto-refresh on app open → Checks for new content since last fetch
6. Content boundary: User completes all available content → Day 11+ shows "Coming Soon" → Message: "You're all caught up! New content is on its way." → Admin notified

**Security:**

- Feed content is read-only for regular users
- Only published content visible to users
- Like functionality requires authentication
- Row-Level Security (RLS) on feed tables

**Data Integrity:**

User profile section with settings, progress display, and feedback history. Settings editable: trigger time, timezone, phone, email, name, display name. Goals NOT editable after onboarding. Pause token count and history displayed.

**Priority:** High  
**PRD Reference:** Section BR-10

**What it does:** Provides user profile page with progress display (streak, XP, status, progress bar) and settings management. Users can edit settings (trigger time, timezone, phone, email, name, display name). Goals cannot be edited after onboarding. Pause token count and history displayed. Feedback history shows all AI feedback received.

**Steps:**

1. User navigates to profile (`/profile`) → System queries `user_lessons` table for current lesson (where status='unlocked' or status='in_progress' with highest day_number) → Displays profile information (display name, streak, XP, status, progress bar, pause token count, current day from user_lessons, longest streak)
2. Progress bar calculation: System calculates progress toward next status level → `(current_xp - current_status_threshold) / (next_status_threshold - current_status_threshold)` → Displays animated progress bar (Framer Motion)
3. Settings management: User clicks "Edit Settings" → Edits trigger time, timezone, phone, email, name, display name → Server Action validates inputs → Updates user record
4. Timezone changes: User changes timezone → System applies to future triggers only (not retroactive) → Streak windows use new timezone going forward
5. Pause token display: Profile shows "Pause Tokens: X remaining" → Expandable section shows token history → Displays when tokens earned/consumed, remaining count after each action
6. Feedback history: User navigates to `/profile/feedback` or `/inbox` → System displays all AI feedback received → Each entry shows date, lesson day, type, content → User can filter by type, search content

**Security:**

- Settings updates require authentication
- Phone number changes require verification
- Goals cannot be edited (enforced at application level)
- Row-Level Security (RLS) on user data

**Data Integrity:**

- Settings stored in `users` table
- Pause token history stored in `user_activity` table (event_type='pause_token_change')
- Feedback history linked via `grading` table (delivered feedbacks)
- Settings updates are atomic (single transaction)

**Data Reliability:**

- Settings persist across system restarts
- Timezone changes apply to future triggers only
- Failed settings updates don't corrupt user data

**Critical Requirements:**

- Goals MUST NOT be editable after onboarding
- Timezone changes MUST apply to future triggers only (not retroactive)

**Indexes**: user_id, event_type, created_at (DESC)

**Purpose**: Unified audit trail for all user activity including XP awards, status changes, streak changes, and pause token changes. Replaces separate `xp_transactions`, `status_history`, `streak_history`, and `pause_token_history` tables.

**Event Type Details:**

- **`xp_award`**: `amount` = XP earned, `metadata.source` = 'qa_completion' | 'challenge_completion' | 'admin_override', `metadata.lesson_id`, `metadata.response_id`

**Indexes**: admin_id, user_id, action_type, created_at (DESC)

**Purpose**: Audit trail for admin user overrides (status, XP, sequential unlock). Does not track configuration changes - those are stored in `admin_config` table.

**Action Type Details:**

- **`status_override`**: Admin overrides user status level. `user_id` = affected user, `old_value.status` = previous status, `new_value.status` = new status
- **`xp_override`**: Admin overrides user XP. `user_id` = affected user, `old_value.xp` = previous XP, `new_value.xp` = new XP
- **`unlock_override`**: Admin toggles sequential unlock override. `user_id` = affected user, `old_value.unlock_override` = previous value, `new_value.unlock_override` = new value

**Indexes**: prompt_type, is_active, created_at (DESC)

**Purpose**: Stores AI grading prompts and rubrics that can be edited by admins in the Admin Panel. Allows content team to manage prompts and rubrics without developer intervention. Prompts are versioned to track changes over time. Active prompts are used for AI feedback generation.

**Usage:**
- Q&A grading prompts: Used for evaluating Q&A responses (correctness scoring)
- Challenge grading prompts: Used for evaluating Challenge responses (4-dimension structured scoring)
- Rubrics: Structured scoring criteria stored as JSONB (dimensions, weights, scoring guidelines)
- Version tracking: Each edit creates a new version for audit trail
- Active flag: Only active prompts are used for grading (allows testing new prompts before activation)

## 12. Technical Roadmap

**Contract Period:** Phase 1 (MVP): 12 weeks  
**Development Model:** Agile with 2-week cycles  
**Team Configuration:** Full-stack development team  
**Target Timeline:** MVP launch with 7-10 days of content

**In Scope for MVP (Phase 1) - Per PRD:**

**Content Delivery Model:**
StoryFirst uses a "rolling delivery" model: Content is uploaded incrementally via Admin Panel as it becomes available, rather than requiring all 70 days complete before launch. MVP launches with 7-10 days of content, with additional days added as client team produces them.

| Category | Features |
|----------|----------|
| **Core Experience** | 7-10 days content at launch (rolling delivery), Daily Lesson flow (Pre-Lesson intro with Gen AI personalization via ElevenLabs TTS, Direct Instruction with karaoke captions, Q&A, Challenge, Post-Lesson wrap-up with Gen AI personalization via ElevenLabs TTS), Block-based CMS for lesson creation |
| **Marketing** | Single-page landing page (static HTML/CSS, no forms). Register for Waitlist button redirects to app. Waitlist registration in app (registration page); bot prevention via "how you heard about it" field |
| **Engagement** | SMS trigger/notification system with dynamic message variants, Streak tracking, XP accumulation, Global leaderboards, Pause Tokens, Celebration Moments (animations + triggers) |
| **Progression** | Status level system (0-3) with XP thresholds |
| **Feedback** | AI Feedback Approval: AI-generated feedback on Q&A and Challenges with Admin Portal approval workflow (MVP) / Elder Portal approval workflow (Phase 2) - weekly batch delivery |
| **Social** | Story Circles (admin-controlled), "Join with Friends" option, Circle leaderboards, WhatsApp integration |
| **Admin** | Content upload/management (CMS with block-based lesson builder), Prompt and rubric management (create/edit/version AI grading prompts), User management, Signup approval queue (approve/reject with optional message), Circle management (manual assignment), Circle bulk communication, Celebration dashboard, XP configuration, Sequential unlock override, Basic data export |
| **Navigation** | Two-tab interface (Learn/Feed), Basic user profile |
| **Testing** | Alpha/Beta feedback tool with Linear integration |

**Dependency note:** Admin Panel (CMS and system config) is scheduled in Cycle 2 so that lesson blocks, XP configuration, and content can be created before the Lesson System (Cycle 3) and Gamification (Cycle 4) experiences that consume them.

### 13.3 Cost Optimization Strategies

**MVP Phase:**

- Template-based personalization (no AI model needed for Pre/Post-Lesson text generation)
- Batch AI feedback generation (weekly delivery)
- Optimize SMS sending (single daily trigger, smart re-engagement)
- **ElevenLabs TTS:** Creator plan ($22/mo) for personalized audio generation. Consider caching frequently used personalized audio or reducing generation frequency to lower costs
- **QStash:** Free tier (1,000 messages/day) covers initial background job needs

**Growth Phase:**

- Consider Gemini 2.5 Flash for grading (cost optimization vs GPT-5 Mini) - already configured as fallback
- Implement response caching for common queries
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- Consider Supabase Enterprise for higher limits
- **ElevenLabs TTS:** At 5,000 generations/day, Creator plan may be insufficient; Scale Plan+ (~$1,500-2,000/mo) may be required. Consider audio caching strategies, template-based generation, or evaluating alternative TTS providers for cost optimization
- **Mux Video:** Usage-based pricing scales with engagement. Consider video caching strategies, optimize video lengths, and monitor delivery costs as user base grows

### 13.4 Scaling Considerations

**User Growth:**

- **MVP Launch:** Current setup sufficient for initial user base
- **500-1,000 users:** May need Supabase Enterprise for higher connection limits, QStash paid tier for increased job volume
- **1,000-5,000 users:** Consider database read replicas, CDN for static assets, optimize TTS caching strategies
- **5,000+ users:** Multi-region deployment, dedicated infrastructure, evaluate TTS cost optimization alternatives

**Content Growth:**

- **7-10 days (MVP):** ~100-200 minutes of video content
- **70 days (Full):** ~1,000-2,000 minutes of video content
- **Mux Pricing:** Usage-based (minutes stored + delivered), scales with engagement
- **Video Storage:** Mux handles all video storage (not Supabase Storage)
- **Future:** Mux scales automatically, no infrastructure changes needed
