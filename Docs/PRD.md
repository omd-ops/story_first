## Introduction

### Document Purpose

This PRD defines business needs, functional requirements, and scope for StoryFirst MVP. It is the foundation for TRD and development planning.

The DevSavant PRD is a **hybrid BRD/PRD**:

- **BRD:** Why are we doing this? For whom? What business outcome? What constraints?
- **PRD:** What exactly are we building? How will it behave? How will we validate it?

**Objectives:**
1. Stakeholders understand what StoryFirst MVP will deliver
2. Development team has clear requirements to build from
3. Success criteria and validation methods defined
4. Scope boundaries (MVP vs future phases) clearly established

**Review requested:** Confirm requirements reflect your vision, scope aligns with expectations, and note any corrections or clarifications before development. Once approved, this PRD guides technical design and execution.

### Project Scope

**In Scope for MVP (Phase 1):**

**Content Delivery Model:**
StoryFirst uses a "rolling delivery" model: Content is uploaded incrementally via Admin Panel as it becomes available, rather than requiring all 70 days complete before launch. MVP launches with 7-10 days of content, with additional days added as client team produces them.

| Category | Features |
|----------|----------|
| **Core Experience** | 7-10 days content at launch (rolling delivery), Daily Lesson flow (Pre-Lesson intro with Gen AI personalization, Direct Instruction with karaoke captions, Q&A, Challenge, Post-Lesson wrap-up with Gen AI), Block-based CMS for lesson creation |
| **Marketing** | Single-page landing page (static HTML/CSS, no logic). Register for Waitlist button redirects to app. Waitlist registration (initial questions) lives in app. Bot prevention via "how you heard about it" field |
| **Engagement** | SMS trigger/notification system with dynamic message variants, Streak tracking, XP accumulation, Global leaderboards, Pause Tokens, Celebration Moments (animations + triggers) |
| **Progression** | Status level system (0-3) with XP thresholds |
| **Feedback** | AI Feedback Approval: AI-generated feedback on Q&A and Challenges with Admin Portal approval workflow (MVP) / Elder Portal approval workflow (Phase 2) - weekly batch delivery |
| **Social** | Story Circles (admin-controlled), "Join with Friends" option, Circle leaderboards, WhatsApp integration |
| **Admin** | Content upload/management (CMS with block-based lesson builder), User management, Signup approval queue (waitlist prioritization), Circle management (manual assignment), Circle bulk communication, Celebration dashboard, XP configuration, Sequential unlock override, Basic data export |
| **Navigation** | Two-tab interface (Learn/Feed), Basic user profile |
| **Testing** | Alpha/Beta feedback tool with Linear integration |

**Out of Scope for MVP:**

| Category | Feature | Rationale | Future Phase |
|----------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Authentication** | Stripe Payment Integration | MVP uses manual admin approval | Phase 2 |
| **Onboarding** | Mailing Address Collection | Physical totems not in MVP | Phase 2 |
| **Onboarding** | Avatar Selection | Display name used instead | Phase 2 |
| **Lessons** | Daily Review Session (A4-A5-A3) | Focus on core lesson flow first | Phase 2 |
| **Notifications** | Two-Way SMS | One-way SMS sufficient for MVP | Phase 2 |
| **Gamification** | Streak Milestone Badges | Visual badges deferred | Phase 2 |
| **Feedback** | Story Elder Feedback System | Elder Feedback (direct evaluation) | Phase 2 |
| **Feedback** | Elder Portal AI Approval | AI Feedback Approval migration (from Admin Portal to Elder Portal) | Phase 2 |
| **Profile** | Memories Playback | Recordings stored but playback deferred | Phase 2 |
| **Profile** | Download Recordings (MP4) | Export functionality deferred | Phase 2 |
| **Marketing** | Marketing Landing Page | Single-page signup form with bot prevention | MVP |
| **Admin** | Goal-Specific Feed Curation | Basic Feed without goal filtering | Phase 2 |
| **Feed** | Feed Content Ordering/Scheduling | Reorder posts or schedule publish dates; content calendar | Phase 2 |
| **Feed** | UGC Consent Flow | Opt-in/consent before admin publishes user content | Phase 2 |
| **Gamification** | XP for Liking Feed Posts | Admin-configurable; disabled in MVP | Phase 2 |
| **Gamification** | XP for UGC Likes (when others like user's content) | Admin-configurable; disabled in MVP | Phase 2 |
| **Admin** | Elder Management | Depends on Elder feature | Phase 2 |
| **Platform** | Native Mobile Apps | Web-first approach | Phase 3+ |
| **Social** | In-App Circle Communication | Real-time chat deferred | Phase 3 |
| **Content** | Level 2 Advanced Content | Post-70 day feature | Phase 3 |
| **Content** | Refresher Challenges | Post-completion feature | Phase 3 |
| **Rewards** | Physical Totems | Logistics complexity | Phase 3 |
| **Content** | Full 70 days at launch | Rolling delivery model | Ongoing |
| **Platform** | Multi-language Support | English only MVP | Phase 2+ |

**Future-Ready Architecture:** User model stores goal fields (not used for personalization in MVP). Response recordings stored for future Memories/Elder. XP admin-configurable (no code changes). Feed supports goal-based filtering (disabled in MVP). Status 2 auto-granted for "Join with Friends." Block-based lesson architecture supports extensible content types.

### Document Structure (Compartmentalized PRDs)

This PRD is the **master document** containing all StoryFirst requirements. Specialized PRDs copy area-specific requirements for compartmentalized verification:

| Document | Location | Covers | Use when |
|----------|----------|--------|----------|
| **Main PRD** (this document) | `discovery-docs/prd.md` | Full scope, all BRs, NFRs, rules, glossary | Authoritative reference; cross-area context |
| **Main App PRD** | `discovery-docs/prd-main-app.md` | Learner app: onboarding, lessons, Feed, profile, XP/streak, circles (user-facing), celebrations, alpha/beta feedback | Verifying or updating main app behavior and BRs |
| **StoryElder Portal PRD** | `discovery-docs/prd-storyelder-portal.md` | Elder portal (Phase 2): Elder feedback, AI approval workflow migration | Verifying or updating Elder portal behavior |
| **Admin Portal PRD** | `discovery-docs/prd-admin-portal.md` | Admin panel: CMS, users, signup queue, feedback review, circles, celebrations, exports | Verifying or updating admin workflows and BRs |
| **Marketing Page PRD** | `discovery-docs/prd-marketing-page.md` | Marketing landing page (static), redirect flow, handoff to app | Verifying or updating marketing/landing scope and BRs |

**Update rule:** When changing requirements, update the **main PRD** (`prd.md`) and the **relevant specialized PRD(s)** so both humans and AI can rely on either the master or the compartmentalized doc.

## Business Context

### Background / Current State

Storytelling is treated as innate rather than learnable; no rigorous programs teach it as daily practice. Sonny Caberwal developed a curriculum for daily micro-learning, inspired by Duolingo, Wordle, Strava.

**Reference Product:** Legends (buildlegends.com)—architectural and UX reference. StoryFirst borrows Legends patterns, adds engagement features (XP, status, social).

### Problem Statement

> Adults who want to improve their storytelling skills need a way to practice consistently because storytelling is treated as an innate talent rather than a learnable skill. Currently, there are no rigorous programs that train storytelling systematically.

**Key Problem Elements (Client's Words):**
- "We've assumed some people 'are just good storytellers' - as if it's a trait you're born with"
- "There are no rigorous programs that train storytelling at all"
- "Your story is too important to let someone else tell. (not lack of will, lack of skill)"

### Business Objectives

| ID | Objective | Measurement |
|----|-----------|-------------|
| OBJ-01 | Validate 70-day storytelling program concept | Testable MVP with 7-10 days of content |
| OBJ-02 | Create habit-forming daily engagement | Streak completion rates, daily session participation |
| OBJ-03 | Build social accountability through circles | Circle participation, peer engagement |
| OBJ-04 | Test gamification as engagement driver | XP accumulation, status progression rates |

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method | Timeline | Owner |
|--------|--------|-------------------|----------|-------|
| Testable Content | 7-10 days complete | Content delivery | Phase 1 (Jan-Mar) | Client (Holly, Jessie) |
| Daily Completion Rate | TBD% (baseline post-launch) | Analytics dashboard | Post-launch baseline | Client + DevSavant PM |
| Average Streak Length | TBD days (baseline post-launch) | Streak tracking | Post-launch baseline | Client + DevSavant PM |
| Status 1 Progression | TBD% of users (baseline post-launch) | Day/Status tracking | Post-launch baseline | Client + DevSavant PM |
| User Retention (Day 7) | TBD% (baseline post-launch) | Cohort analysis | Post-launch baseline | Client + DevSavant PM |

*Note: Specific numeric targets will be established post-launch based on baseline data. Pre-launch targets TBD by Client + DevSavant PM before TRD completion.*

## Product Requirements

### BR-01: User Onboarding

**Priority:** Critical
**Persona:** New User

**Description:** Multi-step onboarding flow collecting user info, preferences, and introducing Coach Devon. Onboarding initializes on the marketing page and continues in the app through a waitlist registration flow, followed by admin approval and magic link access.

**Onboarding Flow Overview:**

| Step | Location | User Action | System Action |
|------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | Marketing page | Sees "Register for Waitlist" (or equivalent) button | — |
| 2 | App (redirect) | Clicks button → lands on app at `app.storyfirst.com/register` | Redirect from marketing page |
| 3 | App | Fills out initial registration questions (name, email, how you heard about it, etc.) | — |
| 4 | App | Submits form | Request sent to admin team; user sees "Thanks for joining the waitlist!" |
| 5 | Admin Portal | — | Admin reviews waitlist, approves request |
| 6 | App (via magic link) | Receives magic link via SMS, clicks to access | User gains access; completes full onboarding (phone verification, goals, schedule, Coach Devon); Day 0 + Day 1 |

**Business Value:** First impression, personalization data, trigger schedule setup.

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to sign up quickly and set preferences so I can start my storytelling journey at a time that works for me.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can enter phone number and verify via SMS code
- [ ] User can enter name and email
- [ ] User can set display name ("How you want your name to appear") - optional, defaults to full name
- [ ] ~~User can select avatar from predefined options~~ [DEFERRED TO PHASE 2]
- [ ] User can select storytelling goals ("click all that apply" format)
- [ ] Optional details field available per selected goal
- [ ] Goal selection UI explains: "This will help us match you with like-minded people and experts!"
- [ ] User asked: "Do you have people you want to go on this journey with?" (Join with Friends)
  - If Yes (2-3 friends): User can invite friends/provide contacts for private circle
  - If Yes (team/company): Show "Contact Admin" instead of "Invite your people"; user indicates interest → email sent to Admin → Admin handles manually. Optionally: shareable link to info page for team signups
  - If No: User starts solo (assigned to goal-based circle by admin later)
- [ ] Users who join with friends receive auto-Status 2 ("Better with Friends" benefit)
- [ ] User can set SMS trigger schedule (days, time, timezone)
- [ ] Time selection uses 15-minute intervals (e.g., 9:00, 9:15, 9:30, 9:45) - aligns with Legends behavior and simplifies backend cron job implementation
- [ ] User timezone editable in settings; changes apply to future triggers only (not retroactive)
- [ ] Streak window calculated in user's current timezone setting
- [ ] **Timezone verification for notifications:** When user selects a time (lesson reminder or snooze), the system MUST resolve the user's timezone to schedule delivery correctly. Users are globally located; all notifications MUST be delivered in the user's local time. System uses stored timezone preference; device/browser timezone as fallback if needed.
- [ ] User sees welcome video from Coach Devon
- [ ] Marketing landing page created (single page, purposely vague - no team/founder info); **static only (HTML/CSS, no logic, no forms)**
- [ ] Landing page structure: Hero ("Tell better stories"), three core features block, "Better with friends" section
- [ ] **Register for Waitlist button (marketing page):** Primary CTA; redirects to `app.storyfirst.com/register`
- [ ] **Waitlist registration (in app):** User arrives via redirect from marketing page, fills initial registration questions: name, email, **"how you heard about it"** (mandatory, anti-bot), goals (optional), reminder time (optional)
- [ ] After form submit, user sees: "Thanks for joining the waitlist! We'll get back to you shortly"
- [ ] **Request sent to admin:** Form submission creates waitlist entry; admin team receives dashboard notification AND Slack message (Slack is notification only; approval happens in Admin Portal or Airtable if configured)
- [ ] Admin Panel shows pending approvals count badge on signup queue
- [ ] Admin reviews waitlist and moves users up/down priority (not binary approve/reject)
- [ ] Admin can add notes to waitlist entries
- [ ] Admin dashboard flags users who reach point thresholds but haven't been assigned to circles
- [ ] Target approval turnaround: within 1 business day
- [ ] Upon approval: User receives magic link via SMS
- [ ] Upon approval: User sees Day 0 content (orientation delivered by Coach Devon - how app works, layout)
- [ ] Day 0 may or may not include name personalization (TBD)
- [ ] Day 1 immediately follows Day 0 (no gap)
- [ ] "Tips and tricks" email triggered simultaneously upon approval
- [ ] User can start first lesson immediately or snooze to scheduled time

**Business Rules:**
- Phone verification required before proceeding
- Email collected but not verified in MVP
- Goals CANNOT be edited after onboarding
- All other settings (time, name, display name) can be edited later
- Avatar selection deferred to Phase 2
- ONB-R01: No Stripe payment in MVP - manual approval gate instead
- ONB-R02: User cannot access lessons until admin approves

**Phase 2 Preparation:** Goal data stored for future personalization (Circles, Elders, Feed). Mailing address added when physical totems introduced.

**Goal Options:**
| Goal | Target Audience |
|------|-----------------|
| Application Storytelling | Job applicants |
| Personal Storytelling (Relationships) | Relationships & dating |
| Marketing Storytelling | Marketers |
| Vision Storytelling | Startup Founders |
| Leadership Storytelling | CEOs or Partners |
| Student Storytelling | School applications |
| Personal Storytelling (Confidence) | Personal confidence |
| Other | Free text input for custom goals |

**Goal Selection Requirements:**
- Goals must be selected in **ranked order** (user prioritizes their goals)
- **Maximum 3 goals** can be selected
- "Other" option available with free text input field
- Multiple goals can be selected ("click all that apply")
- **Primary goal** (first ranked) used for circle assignment and personalization
- Secondary/tertiary goals stored for analytics/marketing but not actively used in MVP

**Goal Usage (MVP):**
- Pre-recorded content: Same for all users (linear curriculum)
- Analytics: Goals stored for marketing/acquisition reports
- *Phase 2: Feed personalization, Circle/Elder matching based on goals*

**Access Control:** No Stripe in MVP. Marketing page: static only (HTML/CSS); Register for Waitlist button redirects to app. Waitlist registration at `app.storyfirst.com/register` requires "how you heard about it" (anti-bot). Admin Portal waitlist (move up/down; Airtable alternative if client prefers). Slack: notification only; approval in Admin Portal. Flow: Marketing page (waitlist CTA) → Redirect to app → User fills initial registration questions → Request sent to admin → Admin approves in Portal → User receives magic link → Day 0 + Day 1 access. Stripe replaces manual gate in Phase 2.

**Day 0 Content:** Coach Devon orientation (how app works, layout, navigation). Day 1 follows immediately. "Tips and tricks" email sent upon approval.

**Open Questions:**
- FEED-01: Clarify how Feed operates and what information is exhibited (Owner: Client)

**Dependencies:**
- Depends on: None (entry point)
- Blocking: BR-02, BR-04

### BR-02: Daily Lesson Delivery

**Priority:** Critical
**Persona:** All Users

**Description:** Daily lesson: Pre-Lesson (Gen AI via Eleven Labs), Direct Instruction (karaoke captions), Q&A, Challenge, Post-Lesson (Gen AI via Eleven Labs). Direct Instruction and Challenge from client via Admin Panel; Pre/Post personalization system-generated.

**Business Value:** Core learning experience; delivers curriculum, captures practice responses.

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive my daily lesson at my scheduled time so I can build a consistent storytelling practice habit.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User receives magic link at scheduled time (SMS)
- [ ] Magic link is single-use, expires after 24 hours if not clicked
- [ ] Clicking link opens web app with authenticated session
- [ ] Authenticated session persists (duration TBD in TRD); user can return to app without new link if session valid
- [ ] If session expired, user must request new magic link via SMS
- [ ] Pre-Lesson plays Gen AI personalized intro (via Eleven Labs) with user name, day, streak
- [ ] Optional personalization block may appear between Direct Instruction and Q&A (small transition: "Hey [Name], now we're going to talk about this thing")
- [ ] Direct Instruction plays main lesson video (~5 minutes) with karaoke-style captions
- [ ] Q&A presents interactive questions requiring user response (text, audio, or closed answers)
- [ ] Privacy notice shown before FIRST recording only
- [ ] User can retry recording before submitting
- [ ] Challenge presents exercise that can be completed or snoozed
- [ ] When user snoozes Challenge, UI shows: "Remind me later" → If yes, then "When?" (time selection)
- [ ] Snooze reminder sent at user-selected time (admin-configured default: 24 hours later)
- [ ] Snooze reminder delivered via SMS magic link (same format as daily lesson trigger)
- [ ] Snooze time interpreted in user's timezone: when user selects a time for snooze, system MUST use user's timezone to set the delivery timer (users are globally located)
- [ ] Snoozed challenges accessible from: Snooze SMS link, user inbox, or user admin panel
- [ ] Users can complete multiple snoozed challenges later (e.g., "do five challenges over the weekend")
- [ ] Post-Lesson plays Gen AI personalized wrap-up (via Eleven Labs) with progress, streak, feedback info
- [ ] Completing Q&A awards base XP (1 XP) and credits streak (all users)
- [ ] Completing Challenge awards bonus XP (2 additional XP) (all users)
- [ ] Total lesson XP = Base XP (1) + Bonus XP (2) = 3 XP per day (or potentially 4 XP - TBD)
- [ ] Status 0 users see: "Great job! Your response has been saved. Complete more lessons to unlock AI feedback!" (XP and streak update visibly)
- [ ] Status 1+ users receive AI feedback weekly via in-app inbox (not immediately; see BR-07B)
- [ ] User navigates to Feed upon completion

**Business Rules:**
- LES-R01: Next day's session unlocks after current day's Q&A completion
- LES-R01A: One lesson per day (default behavior)
- LES-R01B: Lesson unlocks at 12:01am user timezone on next day after completion
- LES-R01C: Admin can enable sequential unlock mode for specific users, bypassing daily restrictions. When enabled, users can complete multiple lessons per day and next lesson unlocks immediately after Q&A completion
- LES-R02: Completing Q&A = base XP (1 XP) - minimum to maintain streak
- LES-R03: Completing Challenge = bonus XP (2 additional XP)
- LES-R03A: Total lesson XP = Base XP (1) + Bonus XP (2) = 3 XP per day (or potentially 4 XP - TBD)
- LES-R03B: XP terminology simplified - just "points", no "partial/full XP" distinction
- LES-R04: Streak credited upon Q&A completion (base XP earned)
- LES-R05: Snoozed challenge triggers reminder at user-selected time (default: 24 hours later, customizable during snooze action)
- LES-R05A: Snooze reminder delivered via SMS magic link (same format as daily lesson trigger)
- LES-R05B: All notifications (lesson triggers, snooze reminders) MUST be scheduled and delivered in the user's local time. System MUST resolve user timezone (from stored preference, or device/browser as fallback) when scheduling any notification, since users are globally located.
- LES-R06: Users cannot complete multiple lessons in one day
- LES-R07: Dynamic trigger message variants based on streak, status, missed days
- LES-R08: Maximum 1 follow-up message (4 hours after initial)
- LES-R09: Response limits per question: Text 2000 characters, Audio 120 seconds. Each question has independent limits.
- LES-R10: Response input types: Text, Audio, Multiple Choice, Image Upload, Video Upload, Audio Upload
- LES-R10A: Number of questions per lesson is flexible (configurable by admin per lesson)
- LES-R10B: MCQ fully configurable: admin sets number of options and single/multiple correct answers
- LES-R10C: Text response length configurable with presets (short/medium/long)
- LES-R10D: Q&A questions appear AFTER Direct Instruction video (not during)
- LES-R10E: Audio prompt signals start of Q&A section
- LES-R11: Magic link delivered via SMS (primary); email fallback if SMS delivery fails
- LES-R12: Users can access lesson at any time after it unlocks (scheduled time or earlier). Magic link works immediately upon unlock. No restriction on accessing lesson before scheduled time.
- LES-R13: SMS trigger time selection uses 15-minute intervals (e.g., 9:00, 9:15, 9:30, 9:45) - consistent with Legends app behavior

**Lesson Structure (MVP) - Block-Based Architecture:**
Lessons are built from **blocks** arranged in a timeline/sequence via CMS:

| Block Type | Content Source | Required? | Notes |
|------------|----------------|-----------|-------|
| Pre-Lesson Personalization | GEN AI (Eleven Labs) | Yes | Always at introduction - personalized greeting with user name, day, streak |
| Direct Instruction | CLIENT-PROVIDED (video) | Yes | Main lesson content with karaoke-style captions |
| Optional Personalization | GEN AI (Eleven Labs) | No | Small transition block between Direct Instruction and Q&A ("Hey [Name], now we're going to talk about this") |
| Q&A | CLIENT-PROVIDED (question prompts) | Yes | Text/audio/MCQ responses; questions shown after video |
| Challenge | CLIENT-PROVIDED (prompt) | Yes | Extended exercise, same for all users |
| Post-Lesson Wrap-up | GEN AI (Eleven Labs) | Yes | Personalized wrap-up with progress, streak, feedback info |

**CMS Block Builder:** Admin creates day → configures settings → adds blocks via plus → configures each (duration, background, content) → reorders drag-and-drop → previews sequence → saves draft → publishes. Blocks extensible for future content types.

**Personalization Block (Pre-Lesson, Optional, Post-Lesson):**
- **Background:** Personalization block MUST support background configuration (upload looping video). Background SHOULD match the main Direct Instruction video for visual consistency. Admin can upload a looping video as background.
- **Dynamic visual layer (optional):** Personalization block MAY include a dynamic visual layer (blob or waveform). When present, the visual MUST be synced with the 11 Labs voice playback. Implementation options: (a) video layer with waveform baked in, or (b) CSS-animated blob + audio-driven waveform (POC recommended). Optional configuration: select blob/waveform style per block.
- **Karaoke-style captions:** Active word highlighted (e.g., white); upcoming words darker or ~50% opacity. Applies to Personalization block (auto-generated from 11 Labs) and Direct Instruction (baked into uploaded video). Reference: Client to provide sample video for caption style.

**Content Sources (MVP):** Client-Provided (Sonny/Client via Admin): all video, Q&A prompts, Challenge prompts, Feed content.

**MVP Features (Client Confirmed):** Pre/Post Gen AI via Eleven Labs (name, day, streak); karaoke captions; dynamic message variants (streak, status, missed days) for SMS and email.

**Open Questions:** 7.1: XP values per action—deferred to TRD (admin configurable).

**Re-engagement Message Schedule:**
| Days Inactive | Message Type |
|---------------|--------------|
| Day 1 | First reminder |
| Day 2 | Second reminder |
| Day 3 | Third reminder |
| Day 4 | Fourth reminder |
| Day 7 | Week reminder |
| Day 10 | Ten-day reminder |
| Day 15 | Final reminder |

*Note: Day spacing and message content are variable and configurable by admin.*

**Lesson Unlock Logic:** One lesson per day (default). Unlock at 12:01am user timezone day after Q&A (e.g., Day 2 Q&A 10:15am 5/1 → Day 3 unlocks 12:01am 5/2). SMS magic link at user's reminder time. Incomplete Q&A = next day locked. **Sequential Unlock Override:** Admin can enable per user; bypasses daily restriction—users complete multiple lessons per day, next unlocks immediately after Q&A (see LES-R01C).

**Dependencies:**
- Depends on: BR-01 (user must be registered)
- Blocking: BR-04, BR-05, BR-06

### BR-03: Daily Review Session [DEFERRED TO PHASE 2]

**Status:** Deferred to Phase 2

**Summary:**
Evening reinforcement session with spaced repetition Q&A. Includes welcome back video (A4), day recap (A5), and retention questions. Awards bonus XP but does not affect streak.

**Rationale for Deferral:**
- Focus on validating core lesson flow first
- Reduces MVP complexity (single daily touchpoint)
- Review content requires additional production from client team

**Phase 2 Implementation Notes:**
- Review trigger sent 8 hours after Lesson completion
- Optional for streak (only Lesson Q&A required)
- Snoozed challenges can be completed during Review
- Gen AI personalization for A4 welcome back video


---

### BR-04: XP and Status System

**Priority:** High
**Persona:** All Users

**Description:** Users progress through status levels (0–3) based on XP earned. Actions earn XP; reaching thresholds unlocks status levels.

**Business Value:** Gamification drives engagement; XP-based status rewards participation and unlocks features.

**User Story:** As a user, I want to earn XP and unlock higher status levels so I feel rewarded and gain access to premium features.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] XP awarded for: Lesson Q&A completion (base XP: 1), Challenge completion (bonus XP: 2)
- [ ] XP values admin-configurable in Admin Panel (not hardcoded)
- [ ] XP terminology: Just "points" - no "partial XP" or "full XP" distinction
- [ ] Status levels based on XP THRESHOLDS (admin-configurable):
  - Status 0: Starting level (0 XP)
  - Status 1: XP threshold TBD (Owner: Client + DevSavant PM, Timeline: Before TRD) - unlocks AI Feedback
  - Status 2: XP threshold TBD (Owner: Client + DevSavant PM, Timeline: Before TRD) - unlocks Story Circles (also auto-granted to users who "Join with Friends")
  - Status 3: XP threshold TBD (Owner: Client + DevSavant PM, Timeline: Before TRD) - *MVP: Pause Tokens (+3 tokens)* | *Phase 2: Priority Elder Feedback*
- [ ] Status is PERMANENT once earned (cannot be lost)
- [ ] Admin can override status for any user
- [ ] Status displayed in user profile and leaderboard

**Business Rules:**
- XP-R01: XP can be earned but not lost
- XP-R02: Status is PERMANENT once earned
- XP-R03: Admin can manually assign any status
- XP-R04: Status is XP-BASED (user actions earn XP toward thresholds)
- XP-R05: XP used for BOTH status progression AND leaderboard ranking

**Phase 2 Preparation:** Status unlocks future features (Circles at Status 2, Elder priority at Status 3). XP admin-configurable (no code changes). "Join with Friends" auto-Status 2 (critical for acquisition).

**Open Questions:**
- 7.1: What are the initial XP values and thresholds for each action/status? (Owner: Client + DevSavant PM, Timeline: Before TRD - admin-configurable in MVP)

---

### BR-05: Streak Tracking

**Priority:** High
**Persona:** All Users

**Description:** Track consecutive days of lesson completion. Streak resets to 0 if user misses a day.

**Business Value:** Proven engagement mechanic; daily habit loop and loss aversion.

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my streak count so I'm motivated to maintain my daily practice.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Streak count displayed throughout experience (Feed, Profile, Learn tab)
- [ ] Streak increments when daily lesson Q&A is completed
- [ ] 24-hour window to complete lesson without breaking streak (midnight user timezone)
- [ ] Pause token system: All users start with 3 pause tokens
- [ ] If user misses a day and has pause tokens: Token automatically consumed, streak preserved, no XP awarded
- [ ] If user misses a day and has no pause tokens: Streak resets to 0
- [ ] Token earning: Status 1 (+1 token), Status 2 (+2 tokens), Status 3 (+3 tokens)
- [ ] Token count displayed in user profile alongside streak
- [ ] When streak resets (no tokens), user sees message on Feed: "Your streak has reset. Start a new one today!"
- [ ] Streak count visible on user profile and leaderboard

**Business Rules:**
- STR-R01: Streak credited upon partial completion (Q&A done)
- STR-R02: 24-hour window resets at midnight user's current timezone setting
- STR-R03: If user misses a day and has pause tokens: Token automatically consumed, streak preserved, no XP awarded
- STR-R03A: If user misses a day and has no pause tokens: Streak resets to 0

### BR-07: Story Elders Feedback System [DEFERRED TO PHASE 2]

**Status:** Deferred to Phase 2

**Summary:**
Human expert feedback from external storytelling professionals. Elders are matched to users by goal expertise and provide written feedback on Q&A and Challenge responses. Includes dedicated Elder Dashboard with goal-filtered submission pools.

**Rationale for Deferral:**
- Requires Elder portal development (separate from user app)
- Needs Elder onboarding and account management
- Goal matching and submission queue system adds complexity
- MVP focuses on AI feedback first; Elder feedback adds human touch in Phase 2

**Phase 2 Implementation Notes:**

**Elder Portal Features:**

1. **Elder Feedback (Direct Evaluation):**
   - Elders evaluate user responses directly (client-requested evaluations)
   - Submission queue filtered by Elder's goal expertise
   - Feedback submission interface for writing direct feedback
   - Written text feedback (1-2 sentences to paragraph)
   - Priority queue for Status 3 users
   - No SLA - feedback delivered whenever Elders have time

2. **AI Feedback Approval (Migration from Admin Portal):**
   - Elders approve AI-generated feedbacks before sending to users (replaces Admin approval workflow)
   - Review interface shows AI draft feedback with approve/edit/reject options
   - Admin Portal feedback review queue transitions to Elder Portal
   - Same approval workflow as MVP Admin Portal, but executed by Elders

**Elder Portal Infrastructure:**
- **Dedicated Elder Portal** — separate from user app with:
  - Submission queue filtered by Elder's goal expertise
  - Feedback submission interface (for direct Elder feedback)
  - AI feedback approval interface (for AI approval workflow)
  - Simple analytics dashboard
- **Elder Onboarding** — Admin creates Elder accounts, assigns goal expertise, sends magic link
- **Submission Assignment** — Hybrid model:
  - Primary: Elders see goal-filtered queue and self-select submissions
  - Secondary: Admin can manually assign specific submissions
- Unified inbox with AI feedback (users see both Elder feedback and approved AI feedback)

**MVP Preparation:**
- User responses are stored and available for future Elder review
- Goal data captured during onboarding for future matching
- Inbox infrastructure built for AI feedback can be extended to Elder feedback

### BR-07B: AI Feedback Approval

**Priority:** High
**Persona:** Status 1+ Users, Admin

**Description:** Status 1+ users receive AI-generated grading on Q&A and Challenge responses. AI generates draft feedback asynchronously after submission. **MVP:** Admin approves all AI feedback via Admin Panel before delivery. **Phase 2:** Workflow migrates to Elder Portal (Elders approve). Approved feedback delivered weekly (batched), not immediately.

**Business Value:** Scalable AI feedback with human oversight for quality. MVP: Admin Portal; Phase 2: Elder Portal.

**User Story:**
As a user who completed lessons, I want to receive curated AI feedback weekly so that I can reflect on my progress in a dedicated feedback moment.

**Admin User Story:**
As an admin, I want to review and approve AI-generated feedback so that I can ensure quality before users receive it.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**AI Feedback Generation:**
- [ ] AI feedback available for Status 1+ users only
- [ ] Status 0 users see: "Great job! Your response has been saved. Complete more lessons to unlock AI feedback!" (XP and streak update visibly, but no AI evaluation)
- [ ] Status 0 user responses are stored and available for AI feedback when they reach Status 1
- [ ] System transcribes audio responses to text (speech-to-text) for AI processing
- [ ] AI evaluates Q&A responses for correctness (pass/fail or comprehension score 0-100%)
- [ ] AI evaluates Challenge responses with structured scores (structure, emotion, clarity, relevance, each 1-5) + written explanation paragraph
- [ ] AI feedback generated asynchronously after user submission (background processing)
- [ ] If AI generation fails, submission still appears in admin queue (marked as "AI unavailable")
- [ ] System retries AI generation up to 3 times on failure; admin notified if all retries fail

**Admin Feedback Review Queue:**
- [ ] New section in Admin Panel: "Feedback Review"
- [ ] Queue displays all submissions with AI-generated feedback pending approval
- [ ] Queue sortable by: submission date, user status, lesson day
- [ ] Queue filterable by: submission type (Q&A/Challenge), status (pending/approved)
- [ ] Admin can click to review a submission
- [ ] No locking mechanism (multiple admins can work simultaneously)
- [ ] Admin dashboard shows pending feedback count
- [ ] Alert if pending queue exceeds threshold (e.g., >50 pending)

**Admin Review Interface:**
- [ ] Admin sees user info: name, email, current day, goal
- [ ] Admin sees original question/challenge prompt
- [ ] Admin sees user response (text or transcribed audio)
- [ ] For audio: Admin can play original recording
- [ ] Admin sees AI-generated feedback (scores + written feedback)
- [ ] For Q&A: Admin sees AI correctness evaluation (pass/fail or score)
- [ ] For Challenges: Admin sees AI scores (structure, emotion, clarity, relevance) and written explanation
- [ ] Admin can approve AI feedback as-is
- [ ] Admin can edit AI feedback before approving
- [ ] Admin can reject AI feedback and write entirely new feedback
- [ ] **"Reject & Regenerate" button:** Trigger AI to generate new feedback (no manual write required)
- [ ] Upon approval, feedback is sent to user
- [ ] System tracks: original AI feedback, admin edits, final approved version, regeneration attempts (align with TRD max 3 retries)

**User App - Feedback Delivery:**
- [ ] Approved feedback delivered WEEKLY (batched) via in-app inbox and/or email
- [ ] Delivery frequency configurable by admin at system/circle/user level (default: weekly)
- [ ] For Q&A: Display correctness result (pass/fail or score)
- [ ] For Challenges: Display structured scores (structure, emotion, clarity, relevance)
- [ ] For Challenges: Display written feedback paragraph
- [ ] All feedback stored persistently in user account
- [ ] User can view historical feedback in Profile > Feedback History
- [ ] Each feedback entry shows: date received, associated lesson day, feedback content
- [ ] Visual notification indicator when new feedback is available

**AI Evaluation Criteria:**

**Q&A Responses:**
```
Input: Question prompt + correct answer (from admin) + user response
Output:
- Correctness: Pass/Fail OR score (0-100%)
- Brief explanation (optional): Why correct/incorrect
```

**Challenge Responses:**
```
Input: Challenge prompt + grading rubric (from admin) + user response
Output:
- Structure score (1-5): How well organized is the story?
- Emotion score (1-5): How emotionally engaging is it?
- Clarity score (1-5): How clear and understandable?
- Relevance score (1-5): How relevant to the challenge prompt?
- Written feedback (1-3 paragraphs): Holistic feedback with specific suggestions
```

**Technical Components:**
- Speech-to-Text Service: Transcribe audio responses (Whisper API or similar)
- Q&A Evaluation Prompt: GPT-4 prompt for correctness evaluation
- Challenge Evaluation Prompt: GPT-4 prompt for structured scoring + explanation
- Async Processing Queue: Background job for AI evaluation
- AI Feedback Storage: Store AI drafts separately from final feedback

**Business Rules:**
- AI-R01: Status 0 users see completion message with XP/streak updates visible, but no AI evaluation - responses stored for future feedback
- AI-R02: AI feedback requires admin approval before being shown to users
- AI-R03: Approved feedback delivered weekly (batched), not immediately
- AI-R04: All feedback stored persistently for user reference
- AI-R05: Audio responses transcribed to text for evaluation (speech-to-text)
- AI-R06: If AI feedback generation fails, system retries up to 3 times; admin notified if all fail
- AI-R07: Feedback delivery frequency configurable at system/circle/user level (default: weekly)
- AI-R08: Admin can approve, edit, or reject AI feedback
- AI-R09: System tracks AI draft, admin edits, and final approved version
- AI-R10: Multiple admins can review simultaneously (no locking mechanism)

**UX Design Rationale:** Feedback intentionally batched to keep user flow quick ("in and out"—few minutes/day). Batching creates anticipation and dedicated "feedback moment." Applies to ALL response types (no MCQ exceptions). Admin approval ensures quality; AI handles evaluation.

**Dependencies:**
- AI provider selection (OpenAI GPT-4, Claude, etc.) - Owner: DevSavant
- Speech-to-text provider (Whisper, etc.) - Owner: DevSavant
- Grading rubric per Challenge - Owner: Client
- Q&A correct answers - Owner: Client
- Admin team bandwidth for review - Owner: Client

**Effort Estimation:**
- Speech-to-Text Integration: 1 day
- AI Evaluation Prompts: 1.5-2 days
- Async Processing Queue: 1 day
- Admin Feedback Queue (2 screens): 1.5-2 days
- User Feedback Delivery: 0.5-1 day
- AI Feedback Storage: 0.5 day
- Testing & QA: 1.5-2 days
- **Total: 7-9 days (~1-1.5 weeks)**

**Phase 2 Enhancement:**
- **AI Feedback Approval Migration:** Approval workflow migrates from Admin Portal to Elder Portal - Elders approve AI-generated feedbacks before sending to users (replaces Admin approval)
- Unified inbox with Elder feedback (see BR-07)
- In-app toast/badge notifications

## Use Cases

### UC-01: Complete Daily Lesson

**Actor:** User
**Preconditions:** User is registered and lesson is available

**Main Flow:**
1. User receives SMS with lesson link at scheduled time (dynamic message variant based on streak/status)
2. User clicks link and lands on Pre-Lesson screen
3. System plays Gen AI personalized intro (via Eleven Labs) with user name, day, streak
4. System auto-advances to Direct Instruction
5. User watches ~5 min lesson video with karaoke-style captions
6. System advances to Q&A
7. User answers each question via text, audio, or selection
8. Response saved; AI feedback generated and queued for approval (MVP: admin approval via Admin Portal; Phase 2: Elder approval via Elder Portal) - delivered weekly
9. System advances to Challenge
10. User completes challenge response
11. Response saved; AI feedback generated and queued for approval (MVP: admin approval via Admin Portal; Phase 2: Elder approval via Elder Portal) - delivered weekly
12. System plays Gen AI personalized Post-Lesson video (via Eleven Labs)
13. System awards XP and updates streak
14. User arrives at Feed

**Alternate Flows:**
- **A1 (First Recording):** Before step 7, if first recording, show Privacy Notice modal. User acknowledges to proceed.
- **A2 (Snooze Challenge):** At step 10, user clicks "Snooze". System schedules SMS reminder at admin-configured time, awards partial XP, navigates to Feed.
- **A3 (Retry Recording):** At step 7 or 10, user can retry recording before submitting.
- **A4 (Status 0):** At steps 8 and 11, user sees "Great job! Your response has been saved. Complete more lessons to unlock AI feedback!" XP and streak update visibly, but no AI evaluation displayed.

**Error Flows:**
- **E1 (Network Error):** Show retry button. User can retry submission. Auto-retry up to 3 times.
- **E2 (Link Expired):** Show "Link expired" message. Generate new link via SMS. User can request new link.
- **E3 (Video Playback Failure):** Show "Video failed to load" message with retry button. If retry fails, show "Please try again later" and allow user to skip to next section or contact support.
- **E4 (AI Feedback Generation Failure):** Show "Feedback processing, please check back in a few minutes" message. System retries up to 3 times. If all retries fail, admin notified. User can continue to Feed; feedback appears later when available.
- **E5 (SMS Delivery Failure):** Automatic email fallback (per NFR). If both fail, user can request new link via app (if session valid) or contact support.

**Postconditions:**
- Partial or full XP awarded
- Streak updated (if Q&A completed)
- AI feedback stored (if Status 1+)
- Next lesson unlocked (next day)
